Information
===========

This is a sample implementation of the 3D pose estimation method described in [1]. It requires the code for learning sparse bases [2] and optimizing the 3D pose from 2D joint locations.

Please download the code from:
(1)  http://spams-devel.gforge.inria.fr/
(2) http://cvxr.com/cvx/ respectively
and put them in the root directory

The package includes a demo (see demo.m) which shows how to use the code. In particular, the demo estimates 3D poses on the HumanEva dataset. The 2D joint locations and the limb lengths are assumed known in this demo, which need to be modified for your own problem.


Acknowledgements: We graciously thank the authors of the previous code releases, e.g., the SPAMS [3] and CVX [2], for making them publically available.
